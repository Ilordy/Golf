Hats are painted with material.

All colors freely can be changed in material properties.

FOR Hyper-Casual Sphere Head characters from my store you need  to parent it into head bone and set local position to zero for hat in head bone and rotate hat by Y = -90.

FOR OTHER CHARACTERS FROM OTHER STORES: You need to parent it into head bone and rotate and move it to best fit.
